"""Extraction as a resumable LangGraph ``StateGraph`` — one checkpoint per page.

This is the payoff slice of the LangGraph migration (#157, ADR-0005/ADR-0006):
a teacher-uploaded PDF is extracted one page per graph super-step, so the
``PostgresSaver`` checkpointer snapshots state after every paid model call. A
run killed mid-paper resumes from the last extracted page instead of
re-billing Gemini from page 1 (Rule 13). The split of responsibilities is
ADR-0006's: the ``IngestionJob`` ledger stays the queryable business record
(status, counts, the poll endpoint) and points at the graph thread via
``thread_id``; everything in-flight lives here, in checkpointer state.

Graph shape: ``plan`` (count pages) → ``extract_page`` (self-loop, exactly one
``SeamExtractor.extract_page`` call per step) → ``persist`` (merge payloads,
then ``Ingestor.ingest_extracted`` — the same guardrail/dedup/persist tail as
both existing front doors). ``persist`` is idempotent under re-run: the
``source_hash`` dedup can only skip, never duplicate, so a crash between
persisting rows and checkpointing cannot double-create ``Question`` rows.

Patterns / invariants:
- ``build_extraction_graph`` takes the checkpointer and ``make_model`` as
  arguments (the injection seams — no module globals), mirroring
  ``build_skeleton_graph`` and ``Ingestor(extractor=...)`` (Rules 9/11).
- State carries the ``job_id`` and the raw page payloads, never the PDF bytes:
  nodes re-read the PDF from the job row so checkpoints stay small. The
  ``payloads`` list is ordered by page (``operator.add`` over a single
  sequential branch), which ``merge_page_payloads`` relies on for figure
  page-rewrite.
- ``split_pages`` never returns an empty list (whole-PDF fallback), so the
  ``plan`` → ``extract_page`` edge needs no guard.

Where it fits:
- Called by: ``bank.management.commands.drain_ingestion_jobs`` via
  ``graph.invoke(state, {thread_id})`` (fresh) or ``graph.invoke(None, ...)``
  (resume).
- Calls into: ``bank.ingestor`` (``SeamExtractor``, ``Ingestor``,
  ``split_pages``, ``merge_page_payloads``).
- Persisted via: LangGraph ``PostgresSaver`` (``workflows.checkpointer``).
